The vegetation burning caused by wildfires can release significant quantities of aerosols and 
toxic chemicals into the atmosphere and result in health risk. Based on my former [work](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114186), 
the present study assesses quantitatively the BaP environment cycling in Africa and its effects on other continents 
from 2001 to 2014.
We show that the African BaP emission from wildfires contributed, to some extent, 
BaP contamination to Europe as well as other regions, depending on source proximity 
and atmospheric pathways under favorable atmospheric circulation patterns.
