We reconstructed PAH emissions from forest fires in the northern boreal forest derived by 
combining forest carbon stocks and MODIS burned area. The results showed that BaP emissions 
from wildfires across the northern boreal forest region played a significant role in the 
contamination and interannual fluctuations of BaP in Arctic air.
